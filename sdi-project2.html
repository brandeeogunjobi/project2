    <h2>Project 2</h2>

<article>
<p>This project is an extension of my original project.  My theme is created around a family event.</p>
<p>The code I used is in regards to the main code on the left of the flow chart.  For example, where the procedure is located in the main code is where I initially started my story as suggested in our training. I did not label every piece of code
that was written inside the function or statement. I do believe I covered every piece of code with some overlap in the beginning, nevertheless covered the bases of the main code.</p>
<p>Thank you and have a wonderful day.</p>
